# euchre_cpp

An opportunity to learn the C++ programming language by writing one of my favorite card games, [Euchre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euchre), in it.

The description of the card game is as follows, quoted directly from Wikipedia:

> Euchre or eucre (/ˈjuːkər/) is a trick-taking card game commonly played in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Great Britain, and the United States. It is played with a deck of 24, 28, or 32 standard playing cards. Normally there are four players, two on each team, although there are variations for two to nine players.
Euchre emerged in the United States in the early 19th century and, while there several theories for its origin,[1] the most likely is that it derives from an old Alsatian game called Jucker.[2] Euchre was subsequently responsible for introducing the joker into the modern deck of cards, first appearing in Euchre packs in the 1860s.
